# Identification of gender based on A/P Pelvic X-ray images
We obtained a sample data set of around 800 x rays split 40-60 between males and females. From there, we tried to use the tensorflow keras model to create a convolution neural network, with 4 different input modifications. They were 1. Raw input scaled down being fed directly into the model, 2,3.using two different variations of canny edge detection program to preprocess the data before feeding it to the model, and 4.Cropping the images to only focus on the region of interest and selectively choosing the dataset, i.e, cropping the images to exclude the edges of the images and not taking any images that showed signs of surgery or modification. We detected the highest accuracy in number 4, with accuracy reaching as high as 95%. The second highest value was seen with the raw image input, which showed accuracy of ~75%. Both methods that used canny edge detection couldn't cross 60% accuracy.
